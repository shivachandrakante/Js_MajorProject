- A like and dislike button will keep incrementing the number of likes/dislikes on the respective comment at every click.
- A delete button will delete the entire comment chain.
- Comments are chained resembling a tree-like structure wherein every child comment will be aligned some pixels left to the parent comment.
- A collapse button closes all the child comments
